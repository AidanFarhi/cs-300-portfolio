- What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

The course centered around developing a program that allows a user to load course data
from a CSV file, display the course information, and search for specific courses.
Emphasis on optimal data structure and algorithm choice was a prominent theme.

- How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

I first considered all the operations that were outlined by the program requirements.
Then I thought through which data structure was most appropriate to leverage within the program.
The main data structures under study in this course were Arrays, Lists, Hash Tables, and Trees.
These are probably the most used structures within modern software.

- How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

When I encountered issues while completing assignments I leveraged the textbook and various online sources.
I found several helpful online articles and also referenced the official C++ documentation.

- How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

I don't typically write out pseudocode when writing real-world programs. I do however use flowcharts and diagrams
quite frequently. Creating the flowcharts and diagrams in this course was a great excercise that definetly
helped solidify my understanding of creating visual representations of programs.

- How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

I liked the fact that the course used C++ as the programming language to implement each program.
I don't use it professionally, so it was cool to dive deeper into the language.
I think using a "lower-level" language like C++ forced me to really think through each detail of the program.
That practice of deep thinking definetly improved my ability to write maintainable, readable, and adaptable programs.
