- What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

The course centered around developing a program that allows a user to load course data
from a CSV file, display the course information, and search for specific courses.
Emphasis on optimal data structure and algorithm choice was a prominent theme.

- How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

I first considered all the operations that were outlined by the program requirements.
Then I thought through which data structure was most appropriate for solving the program.
The main data structures chosen in this course were Lists, Hash Tables, and Trees.
